Those of which are present in that space are able to schedule a date on which they will go and enjoy what is being played in that moment. They will go there and throw themselves into the experience. Will someone do this? Is this something that is possible or am I just dreaming? Who is going to do this? What does the place offer that person? These are all questions that I have in my mind. Isn't it too much to go into a place and spend 4 hours alone flying with your own mind? How does this relate to what that person needs? What does this speak about depression? How will this place help that person with her depression? What is the connection? Is this something real or am I just imagining it? The thing is to see this whole adventure as something more that a way of earning money. It is an experience to be lived.
