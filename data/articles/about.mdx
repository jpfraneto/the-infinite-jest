I had to come here to write this down so that I can better understand what this project is about. I already built the landing page with the youtube videos being played 24/7. That was straightforward. Now I need to make it easy for new users to add styling options to it. Fork the github repo and add the styles that she wants. That is something that I need to work on, since it is part of the core functionality of what I'm building here.

How do I imagine this place? It will be what will be running in the TV that will located in the office, and the office is a place which's only light comes from the TV. It is a signal of what can happen when we let entertainment rule our lifes.

Each location will have its own information, what comes to mind right now is:

- Members: It is something like a club, on which people from the city where the location is can be part of this space. Those of which are present in that space are able to schedule a date on which they will go and enjoy what is being played in that moment. They will go there and throw themselves into the experience. Will someone do this? Is this something that is possible or am I just dreaming? Who is going to do this? What does the place offer that person? These are all questions that I have in my mind. Isn't it too much to go into a place and spend 4 hours alone flying with your own mind? How does this relate to what that person needs? What does this speak about depression? How will this place help that person with her depression? What is the connection? Is this something real or am I just imagining it? The thing is to see this whole adventure as something more that a way of earning money. It is an experience to be lived. And people can ask for a piece of the product that they can bring into their houses. Or not? Are people going to be able to take a product to their house? Of course they are. And that's why the label will have a QR code, which will bring them into www.theinfinitejest.tv. That is an amazing part of this whole system. That is the magic.

- Calendar: Members will be able to select a day on which to go to the spaceship, and through that connect with their deepest core by consuming the content that will be available for them.
