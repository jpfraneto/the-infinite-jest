I'm here again, trying to understand. Writing to think. I write so that I can think. The first time that I read that it made a lot of sense to me. Because I haven't really made myself the time to fully understand what this project is about, it is a constant exploration and discovery.

Right now I have been working on the page of the host of a particular instance of The Infinite Jest. The only host that exists now is me, located in Puerto Varas. But what happens when there is a new one? How does he become part of this adventure? What does he offer? Isn't it great that each person is able to share whatever he wants with the community? If there is a musician, perharps he can deliver and share his musicianship. If he is a tattoo artist, he can also share this. Why limit the capacity of sharing to a jar of a strong cannabis edible? Why should I do this? It doesn't make sense. I need to leave it open.

How is John, from boston massachussets going to be able to create an instance of the infinite jest where he lives? What does it need to happen in order for this to be a reality? I need to be able to share the message in a clear way in the website, so that people can come in and be interested in being part of this thing.
