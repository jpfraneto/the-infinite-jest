My name is JP, and I'm a very big fan of the unknown. I created The Infinite Jest as a means of exploring consciousness through the exposure to random content that can split your skull in two and turn your brain and all of its content upside down.

What comes after the realization that you are more than what you think you are?

I strongly believe that the answer to this is a deep drive to make the world a better place. At least for me, it has been like that. This space is a consequence of that quest. I hope that I managed to build it in a way that makes sense.
